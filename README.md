# Rock üëä Paper ‚úã Scissors ‚úå

## How it works?

Once the page is loaded, the game requests access to your web camera when you press the play button and begins taking snapshots. The snapshots are passed to the Mediapipe Hands Solution to obtain hand landmarks. When the 3-second timer runs out, a Random Forest Classifier will use the obtained hand landmarks and try its best to predict your token. The predicted token is compared with the choice simultaneously made by the computer, and the scoreboard is updated accordingly

## Building the classifier

### Dataset

1. Images were collected from the sources tabulated below

| Source # | Link                                                              |

| 5        | https://www.kaggle.com/anirudhabhagwat/rock-paper-scissors-images |

2. Images having more than 98% percent similarity were removed
3. Hand landmarks were obtained using the MediaPipe's hands solution and then stored in seperate CSV files as per source

### Model

A Random Forest Classifier model was trained on the collected landmarks to classify hand pose into either paper, rock or scissors. The evaluation metrics for the classifier are shown below. Other classification models performed with about 2 per cent less accuracy than Random Forest Classifier.
